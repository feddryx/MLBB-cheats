Cheating in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang game.

### Requirement
* [GameGuardian](https://gameguardian.net)

### FAQ
* To prevent got banned, only activate the script in the Custom Mode with enabling airplane mode or turn off your mobile data and Wi-Fi. And then exit the script and close your GameGuardian app before turning on the network again. But as always, do with your own risk!
* If the camera angle still not changed even you have activate it already, try to go to the setting and select "Camera Height: High" to refresh the camera.
* "The camera hack says the value are not found!", It might be you've activate it and then close the script and want to change it again. I haven't make it detect the modified camera value so currently it won't be work.
